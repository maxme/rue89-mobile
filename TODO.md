## HTML5 app
* Refresh button or "pull to refresh"
* Better article presentation
* Generate html page when downloading article
* Cache images (base64 ?)
* Investigate for better responsiveness (removing slide transition did something)
* BUG: flashing transition (try:    -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden )

## Done
* BUG: icon are shifted in buttons (caused by beta-build of jquerymobile)
